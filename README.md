# linebuf

A very simple C library for managing a line buffer.

Right now, if you compile this with `make`, you will get `liblinebuf.a`, which you can statically link in with whatever you are using this with.

Read the header for documentation, or run `doxygen` and open `doc/html/index.html` in your favourite browser for something slightly more nicely-formatted.
